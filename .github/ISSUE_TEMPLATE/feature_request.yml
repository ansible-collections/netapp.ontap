      **Thank you for wanting to suggest a feature for netapp.ontap!**

      💡
      Before you go ahead with your request, please first consider if it
      would be useful for majority of the netapp.ontap users. As a
      general rule of thumb, any feature that is only of interest to a
      small sub group should be [implemented in a third-party Ansible
      Collection][contribute to collections] or maybe even just your
      project alone. Be mindful of the fact that the essential
      netapp.ontap features have a broad impact.

      ⚠
      Verify first that your idea is not [already requested on
      GitHub][issue search].

      Also test if the main branch does not already implement this.

      I am trying to do X with netapp.ontap from the devel branch on GitHub and
      I think that implementing a feature Y would be very helpful for me and
      every other user of netapp.ontap because of Z.
