        **Thank you for wanting to suggest a feature for netapp.ontap!**

        üí°
        Before you go ahead with your request, please first consider if it
        would be useful for majority of the netapp.ontap users. As a
        general rule of thumb, any feature that is only of interest to a
        small sub group should be [implemented in a third-party Ansible
        Collection][contribute to collections] or maybe even just your
        project alone. Be mindful of the fact that the essential
        netapp.ontap features have a broad impact.

        ‚ö†
        Verify first that your idea is not [already requested on
        GitHub][issue search].

        Also test if the main branch does not already implement this.

        and how it solves the problem you described.

        I am trying to do X with netapp.ontap from the devel branch on GitHub and
        I think that implementing a feature Y would be very helpful for me and
        every other user of netapp.ontap because of Z.
